Published in : 'MHE - Performance Analysis and Comparison of Metaheuristics for 
                Generating Ensembles of Classifiers'

Description : 	'Accumulates outputs of MHEMetaheuristicEnsembles and performs
	   	test set predictions of ensembles. Predictions are tested for
		differences among scores and among metaheuristics by means of
		the Friedman test. The four best metaheuristics are compared to 
		best base model, simple average ensemble, greedy optimization 
		technique, ensemble selection and LASSO regression.'

Inputs:	'A string path for the initial working directory. This working 
       	directory must contain a folder named datasets in which data 
       	sets in .txt-format are stored, and another folder named predictions 
	that contains outputs produced by MHEModelClassifiers and
	MHEMetaheuristicEnsembles.'

Output:	'MHEEnsembleEvaluation_01   -	Mean ranks of scores in Friedman test regarding score differences in AUC
	MHEEnsembleEvaluation_02   -	Boxplots of scores regarding computation time
	MHEEnsembleEvaluation_03   -	Corrected p-values in post hoc test regarding AUC
	MHEEnsembleEvaluation_04   -	Mean ranks of scores in Friedman test regarding computation time
	MHEEnsembleEvaluation_05   -  	Mean ranks of scores in Friedman test regarding sparsity
	MHEEnsembleEvaluation_06   -  	Corrected p-values in post hoc test regarding differences of scores in sparsity
	MHEEnsembleEvaluation_07   -	Boxplots of scores regarding percentage of zero weights
	MHEEnsembleEvaluation_08   -	Boxplots of metaheuristics regarding computation time
	MHEEnsembleEvaluation_09   -	Mean ranks of metaheuristics in Friedman test regarding Brier score

	MHEEnsembleEvaluation_17   -	Corrected p-values in post hoc test regarding differences of metaheuristics in sparsity
	MHEEnsembleEvaluation_18   -	Boxplots of metaheuristics regarding percentage of zero weights
	MHEEnsembleEvaluation_19   - 	Table of best metaheuristics compared to other techniques based on Brier score 								relative to global optimum.'
