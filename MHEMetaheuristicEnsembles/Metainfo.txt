Name of QuantLet : MHEMetaheuristicEnsembles

Published in : 'MHE - Performance Analysis and Comparison of Metaheuristics for 
                Generating Ensembles of Classifiers'

Description : 	'Optimizes the weights in classifier ensembles to fitness
		functions Brier score, H-measure, difficulty and interrater agreement 
		with 16 different metaheuristics. For each metaheuristic/fitness function
		combination, a structure with classifier weights, computation time and
		final fitness is created and stored.'

Inputs:
- path : 'initial working directory (This working directory must 
		contain a folder named predictions with subfolders for each 
		data set in which outputs of ModelClassifiers.R are stored, 
		i.e.: datasetname-predTrain.csv, datasetname-obsTrainNum.csv.
		path also needs to contain all .m-files called by 
		MetaheuristicEnsembles.m)'
- cl : number of clusters for parallel computing

Output: 'Structures in .mat-format for each metaheuristic/fitness function 
	combination consisting of weights, computation time and final fitness 
	stored in subfolder of predictions for respective data set.'

Keywords : data mining, simulation, classification, parameter, sampling, machine learning, ensemble of classifiers, metaheuristic
