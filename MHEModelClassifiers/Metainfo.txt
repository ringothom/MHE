Published in : 'MHE - Performance Analysis and Comparison of Metaheuristics for 
                Generating Ensembles of Classifiers'

Description : 'Estimates machine learning models for one or more data sets 
              with binary classification task. Data sets are split into 
              training and testing data, models are estimated on the training 
              data and stored. For each data set, model predictions on 
              training and testing data are stacked into dataframes which are 
              also stored.'

Inputs:
- path : 'initial working directory (This working 
        	directory must contain a folder named datasets in which data 
        	sets in .txt-format are stored)'
- cl : number of clusters for parallel computing'

Output: 'The working directory given by path will contain two 
        additional folders: models and predictions. models will 
        have subfolders named as the data sets in datasets. In these 
        subfolders machine learning models are stored. predictions 
        will have subfolders named after the data sets which contain the
        data set partitioning vector, the stacked predictions for
        training and testing data and training set observations.'

Keywords : data mining, simulation, prediction, support vector machine, model, machine learning, ensemble of classifiers
